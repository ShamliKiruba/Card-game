Setup DB mock. A context builder



1. Remove static player count from 4 and set max to 10
2. Divide cards randomly - few players will have extra others less number of cards
3. Remove time for each player's turn


Later:

4. Ramdonly drop card a valid card if player didnt select one
5. if player don't have that symbol, skip tuen, he loses a winning chance
